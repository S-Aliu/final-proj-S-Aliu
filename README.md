# Final Project

This is a place where you should keep track of your project. 

## Add partner as collaborator

Go to settings, collaborators and add your partner as a collaborator

## Creating branches

When creating features be sure to follow the format:

`<username>/<feature>`

Therefore if I was working on a login feature my branch would be called: 

`jd12/login`

## Web Development - Set up vagrant box 

Run `vagrant up`

Run `vagrant ssh`

Inside your vagrant box run 

`sudo bash pg_config.sh`

## Game Development - Set up Unity for Github

Start a new Unity project (Be sure you and your partner agree to the same version)

Add [Unity for Github](https://unity.github.com/)
